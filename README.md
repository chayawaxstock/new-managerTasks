## Description
 
 * [To desciption of the project follow this link](https://github.com/AnnaKarpf/Full-stack-web-development_4578-2/blob/master/12_Web%20api/final%20project.docx)

## Development server

To install the app in your computer you have to:
  1. [Run the `mySql` code](https://github.com/chayawaxstock/finishcourseseldat/blob/master/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%98%20%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%99%20%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%98/%D7%93%D7%98%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A1/database.sql)
      To see some data in the live demo, you should add data to your tabels or
      [Run the data- script code](https://github.com/tamarosenzweig/TaskManagmant/blob/master/mysql-script.md)
      

  2. Run the `back-end` project.(the web api one)  This is the server. Navigate to `http://localhost:12988/`. 
     The app will automatically reload 
     
     
  3.  Run the `php` server by 
        ```sh 
        shift+f6
        ```
        on the index.php page

  4.  Run `ng serve` for a dev server, if you want to run the angular project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
      The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
      shoose which server you want to: the web api or the php one in the `global` page. update it.

  5. Run the winform project, if you want it to be the client.
  
  6. Run the windows service
      * Go to Start, Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio Tools, then Developer Command Prompt for VS2012. (Right click on it and         select Run as administrator).
      * Set path of your Windows Service's .exe file in command prompt (e.g. "C:\Users\USER1\Documents\Visual Studio 
        2012\Projects\WindowsServiceProject1\bin\Debug\").
      * Then run the command: "InstallUtil WindowsServiceProject1.exe". Now your service is successfully installed in your system.
      * Now go to Control Panel, Administrative Tools, then Services and find the service name as your windows service (eg.  
        TestService).
        
        Windows Service is implemented and installed successfully in your system and will send mail daily itself at the time which 
        specified App.Config file. 

      
          *important note: in order to `send email` feature  from the php server(just if you have xampp) in your computer follow this
           instruction:* 
        
        in php.ini file find [mail function] and change
        ```sh
        SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
        smtp_port=587
        sendmail_from = my-gmail-id@gmail.com
        sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
        
        ```

        Now Open C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.ini. Replace all the existing code in sendmail.ini with following code
        ```sh
        [sendmail]

        smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
        smtp_port=587
        error_logfile=error.log
        debug_logfile=debug.log
        auth_username=my-gmail-id@gmail.com
        auth_password=my-gmail-password
        force_sender=my-gmail-id@gmail.com
        ``` 

        PS: don't forgot to replace my-gmail-id and my-gmail-password in above code.
        Also remember to restart the server using the XAMMP control panel so the changes take effect.
## Tech

Task Managmant uses a number of extension:

*in php platform we use:*

* [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) - Installers and Downloads for Apache Friends!

*in web api platform we use:*
   
* from [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors/) we use the Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors
* from [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data/) we use the MySql.Data

*in angular platform we use:*
    
  * [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.
        
    * [Angular kendo](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/) Kendo UI for Angular 
        
    * [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) beatifull java script pop up   

*in winform platform we use:* 

* [Telerik](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/introduction) Performance you demand, UI you can't believe
